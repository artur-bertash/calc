# Calculator

This project was built for The Odin Project. I decided to structure my knowledge in JavaScript, so I chose to relearn a lot of stuff through hands-on practice. This is a simple on-screen calculator made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that performs basic arithmetic operations without using `eval()`.
